# PRIVACY POLICY

**Last Updated: [replace with date]**

## Overview

Synco is a Google Sheets add-on that allows users to connect their own QuickBooks account and pull financial data directly into their spreadsheet. Synco does **not** collect, store, transmit, or analyze any user information. All data processing occurs entirely within the user’s own Google Workspace environment.

By using Synco, you acknowledge that you are solely responsible for how you access, manage, and protect your own QuickBooks and Google Workspace data.

## Data We Collect

**We do not collect any personal data.**
We do not store, log, or transmit:

* QuickBooks data
* Google Sheets data
* User credentials
* OAuth tokens
* IP addresses
* Usage analytics
* Device information
* Cookies or trackers

Synco does not have a backend server, database, or any external infrastructure that receives or processes data.

---

## How Synco Works

Synco runs entirely inside your Google Workspace session.

* All QuickBooks requests are made directly from your Google account to QuickBooks.
* All returned data is written directly into your Google Sheet.
* No part of this data ever passes through infrastructure controlled by Synco or its developers.

Because of this architecture:

* We do not have access to any of your data.
* We cannot read, modify, or delete anything in your Google account.
* We cannot see your QuickBooks information at any time.

---

## Third-Party Services

Synco interacts only with:

1. **Google Workspace (Google Sheets / Apps Script)**
2. **QuickBooks Online API**

Your use of these services is governed by their respective privacy policies.
Synco has no visibility into the data exchanged between those platforms.

---

## Data Security

Because Synco does not collect, transmit, or store any data:

* We do not hold any data that could be breached.
* We do not have systems that could expose your information.

Your data security is entirely dependent on:

* Your Google Workspace configuration
* Your QuickBooks account settings
* Your OAuth permissions
* Your own device and network security

You are fully responsible for managing and protecting your credentials and data.

---

## User Responsibility

By using Synco, you agree that:

* You assume all risk associated with connecting QuickBooks to Google Sheets.
* You are solely responsible for any financial, privacy, or security impacts of importing your own data.
* You will not hold the Synco developers liable for any data loss, data exposure, or account issues related to your use of the tool.
* You understand that this tool is provided **“as is”** without warranties of any kind.

---

## No Warranty

Synco is provided on an **as-is**, **as-available** basis.
We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

## No Liability

Under no circumstances shall Synco or its developers be liable for:

* Loss of data
* Unauthorized access to your accounts
* Financial loss
* Security breaches in your Google or QuickBooks environment
* Misuse or misconfiguration of the tool by the user

Your use of Synco is entirely at your own risk.
